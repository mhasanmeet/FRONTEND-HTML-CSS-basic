# BEM (Block Element Modifier)

BEM is a CSS best practice paradigm, but to me, this topic should be in HTML part, as it start from HTML, that's why I put it in HTML.

By using BEM we can keep our css code clean as simple, maintainable and more readable. BEM is a modern CSS architecture use in plain HTML & CSS. 

As an example we have in this folder a HTML & CSS project where we use BEM architecture.
