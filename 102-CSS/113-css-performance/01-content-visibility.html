        The content-visibility property accepts three main values:
        * visible
        * hidden
        * auto (important)  
    
        "content-visibility" works best with content that:
        * Is below the fold (not visible when the page first loads): For example, it's outside of the initial viewport
        * Is self-contained (doesn't affect other parts of the page): For example, it doesn't change the layout when it's rendered, and doesn't have styles that affect other elements
        * Has a substantial rendering cost (like complex layouts): For example, a long list of UI components, blog posts in a feed, a long comment thread, etc.

        You should be careful when using content-visibility because it can have unintended consequences. 
        Here are examples:
        * Content in the initial viewport (what users see first): This feels like lazy loading your LCP image!
        * Small elements with a minimal rendering cost: You should avoid premature optimization and only use content-visibility when it's effective
        * Elements whose size might affect the page layout significantly: This can lead to unexpected results when the content is rendered
