    Here's a question with a surprisingly-complex answer: 
    how does the browser decide which element to render "on top" when elements overlap?

    It depends on the layout mode!

    In Flow layout, elements don't overlap much, but we can force it with negative margin:
  -->
  <style>
      .box {
        width: 50px;
        height: 50px;
        border: 3px solid;
        background: silver;
      }

      .second.box {
        margin-top: -30px;
        margin-left: 20px;
        background: hotpink;
      }
  </style>
  <div class="container">
      <div class="first box"></div>
      <div class="second box"></div>
  </div>
  <!-- 
    In this case, the DOM order matters. The pink box comes after the silver box in the DOM, 
    and so it's painted on top.

    There is one catch, though: in Flow layout, content is painted separately from the background.

    Check out what happens if we add some text to these boxes:

  <hr>

  <!-- 
    In Flow layout, background colors and borders are truly meant to be in the background. 
    The content will float on top. That's why the letter A shows up on top of the pink box.

    The truth is that Flow layout isn't really built with layering in mind. 
    Most of the time, when we want to layer elements, we'll want to use positioned layout.

    Check out what happens if we add relative positioning to the silver box:
  -->
  <style>
    .box {
      text-align: center;
    }
  
    .second.box {
      margin-top: -30px;
      margin-left: 20px;
      background: hotpink;
    }
  </style>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="first box">A</div>
    <div class="second box">A</div>
  </div>

</body>
